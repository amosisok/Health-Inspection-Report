# Health-Inspection-Report

This was our group term project for CMPT 276 in Sring 2020. In a group of 4, we created an android app that displays restaurant hazard ratings along with their health inspection reports. This can be useful when you for looking up places you are about to eat at to make sure you won't be sick after you eat there. This project was developed in Java using Android Studio.

Features:
- Google Maps API integration
- Searching and filtering for specific restaurants
- Ability to retreive updated restaurant reports when available
- Favourite specific restaurants for quick access
